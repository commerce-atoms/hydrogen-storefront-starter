# Documentation

This folder documents the **reference architecture** for this Hydrogen storefront boilerplate.

**Purpose:**

- Explain how the project is structured
- Define architectural constraints and why they exist
- Guide feature development without creating structural debt

**This is not a framework or generator.** It's a baseline structure meant to be cloned and adapted for real storefronts.

**Authoritative sources:**

- Enforced rules: `.cursor/rules/*` and `app/tests/*` (smoke tests)
- Architectural intent and guidance: This documentation

## What This Repository Is

A **module-driven architecture** for Shopify Hydrogen storefronts built on React Router.

**Key characteristics:**

- **Vertical domain slices** - Each module owns routes, UI, data, and logic
- **Explicit, config-based routing** - Single route manifest
- **Minimal global shared code** - Isolated modules
- **Predictable growth patterns** - Start flat, grow incrementally

**Designed for:**

- Multi-feature storefronts
- Long-lived codebases
- Teams that need clarity and refactor safety

---

## What This Repository Is Not

- ❌ Not a replacement for Hydrogen or React Router
- ❌ Not a meta-framework
- ❌ Not a routing abstraction
- ❌ Not opinionated about UI design systems or styling
- ❌ Not optimized for one-off or short-lived sites

**If you need a fast prototype or very small store, the default Hydrogen starter may be more appropriate.**

## Quick Start

### For New Contributors

**Recommended reading order:**

1. **This file** - Overview and structure
2. [reference/modules.md](reference/modules.md) - Modules, structure, and import rules
3. [reference/routing.md](reference/routing.md) - How routes work
4. [governance/governance.md](governance/governance.md) - Constraints and review process
5. [guides/add_feature.md](guides/add_feature.md) - Add your first feature

**You don't need to read everything up front.** Use these documents as reference when making structural decisions.

## Using This Boilerplate

### Typical Workflow

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Build a real storefront on top of it**
3. **Make project-specific decisions in your clone**
4. **Promote changes back to boilerplate** only if they are:
   - Generally useful
   - Non-opinionated
   - Not tied to a specific product or brand

This keeps the boilerplate stable and reusable.

### When to Update Docs

**Update documentation when:**

- ✅ Changing architectural constraints
- ✅ Adding new enforced rules
- ✅ Introducing new folder patterns
- ✅ Changing module boundary rules

**Don't update documentation for:**

- ❌ Project-specific features
- ❌ One-off patterns
- ❌ Experimental code not yet validated

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Explicit Over Implicit

- Single route manifest (`app/routes.ts`)
- Explicit imports (no barrel files)
- Explicit module boundaries

### 2. Modules Own Features End-to-End

- Each module owns routes, UI, GraphQL, utilities
- Zero cross-module imports
- Modules are deletable

### 3. Start Flat, Grow Incrementally

- No premature folder structure
- Add complexity only when friction appears
- Folders have clear thresholds (e.g., 3+ routes → `routes/` folder)

### 4. Boundaries Are Enforced

- TypeScript path aliases
- ESLint rules
- CI smoke tests
- Code review

## Getting Help

### Common Questions

**Q: Can modules import from other modules?**  
A: No. Never. See [reference/modules.md](reference/modules.md#cross-module-reuse-ladder) for reuse strategies.

**Q: Where should this component go?**  
A: See [reference/modules.md](reference/modules.md#shared-components-vs-module-components).

**Q: How do I add a new route?**  
A: See [guides/add_feature.md](guides/add_feature.md).

**Q: My GraphQL file is too large. What now?**  
A: See [guides/scale_graphql.md](guides/scale_graphql.md).

**Q: What belongs in `app/platform/`?**  
A: See [reference/platform.md](reference/platform.md).

## Guiding Principle

**The structure should remain understandable as the application grows.**

When in doubt:

- Prefer explicitness over convenience
- Keep features self-contained
- Avoid introducing new global abstractions
