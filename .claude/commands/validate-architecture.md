# `/validate-architecture`

Run the architecture validators against a Hydrogen storefront project.

## Workflow

1. Resolve the target directory:
   - If the user supplied a path, use it.
   - Otherwise, use the current working directory.
2. Invoke the CLI:

   ```bash
   npx @commerce-atoms/agents validate-architecture --out <path>
   ```

3. Read the human-readable output. If exit code is non-zero, summarise violations grouped by `code` for the user.
4. After structural changes (new module, manifest edits, shared-folder promotions), paste the summary into the PR or notes before marking work complete.

## Output expectations

- **PASS** — exit 0, no further action needed.
- **WARN** — exit 0 (unless `--strict`), but surface the warnings to the user with their remedies.
- **FAIL** — exit 1, list every error with file path and remedy. Do not mark the work complete until errors are addressed or explicitly accepted.
