IMPORT POLICY (REACT ROUTER)

This Hydrogen project uses React Router packages, not Remix packages.

FORBIDDEN

- Any imports from @remix-run/\*
- Any imports from react-router-dom

REQUIRED

- Use react-router (and @react-router/\* packages) consistent with the existing codebase.

WHEN COPYING EXTERNAL EXAMPLES

- Translate @remix-run/react usage to the equivalent React Router usage used in this repo.
- Before introducing a new @react-router/\* package import, verify it is already used in the repo or is required by the current code path.

DEFAULT PRACTICE

- Match import patterns already present in adjacent files.
