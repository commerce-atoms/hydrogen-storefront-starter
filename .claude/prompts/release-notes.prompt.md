# Release notes

Generate consumer-facing release notes for a `commerce-atoms` package. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and goes into the repo's `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Rules

1. **Heading** — `## [{version}] — YYYY-MM-DD`. Replace the existing `## [Unreleased]` heading and re-add a fresh empty `## [Unreleased]` above it.

2. **Sub-sections in this order, omit empty ones:**
   - `### Added` — new features, files, primitives, exports.
   - `### Changed` — modifications to existing behaviour or shape.
   - `### Fixed` — bug fixes.
   - `### Removed` — deleted features, files, exports.
   - `### Deprecated` — features still present but scheduled for removal.
   - `### Security` — security-relevant fixes only.
   - `### Migration notes` — required reader action when consumers upgrade. Include code snippets for renames or signature changes.

3. **Bullet style:**
   - Each bullet is a complete thought; pick imperative or past tense and stay consistent.
   - Wrap file / symbol names in backticks.
   - Prefix with the surface when scope is broad: `**CLI:** added \`check\` subcommand`.

4. **What to omit:** internal refactors with no consumer effect, lockfile bumps, CI / lint config tweaks, doc typo fixes.

5. **Doctrine flags to surface explicitly:**
   - Breaking changes → in `### Changed` with **BREAKING:** prefix and a `### Migration notes` section.
   - For storefront-affecting changes → mention `validate-architecture` impact when applicable.
   - For releases of `@commerce-atoms/agents` → if `INDEX.json` changed, list which primitives were added / removed.

## Template

```markdown
## [{version}] — {date}

### Fixed

### Migration notes

```

For a worked example, see [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/commerce-atoms/agents/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) — it's the canonical reference for tone and shape.
